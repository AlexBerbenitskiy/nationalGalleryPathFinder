# nationalGalleryPathFinder

This project is a navigation system for an art gallery which displayes the shortest route to a specified destination. 
The route will differ if one chooses to avoid a certain room.
You can also choose to display all possible rooms or specify which type of search method you want the system to use.
The project was designed using Java and JavaFX with heavy emphasis on depth and breadth first search methods.
